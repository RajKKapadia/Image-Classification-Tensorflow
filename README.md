# Complete Guide to Image Classification using Tensorflow

Hello friends, here is a complete guide on Image Classification using [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf). You will find Python code to the following things:

* load data with image augmentation
    - direct from folder
    - from a csv file
    - visualize the images
* build a model
    - CNN model from scratch using `Model` or `Sequesntial` class
    - CNN model using a pre-trained model, commonly known as `Transfer Learning`
* train the model
    - plot the history of the training
* predict the classes
    - predict from a data generator
    - predict on a single image
* Save & load the model

`Youtube` videos on this is available [here]().

#### Dataset
The dataset used in this work can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/puneet6060/intel-image-classification).

#### Notebooks
The notebooks are self explainary in evry way, though I thought to explain them here as well.

* `data_loader.ipynb`, it containes the Python code to load the image data, using `ImageDataLoader`, also there are two ways to visualize the image data is shown
* `create_model.ipynb`, this notebook show you the two ways that can be used to build a model
* `train_simple_model.ipynb`, this notebook shows the training process on a simple CNN architecture build from scratch.
* `train_transfer_learning.ipynb`, this notebook explaines the transfer learning way to train a CNN model.
